Hello, welcome to my world! I am currently a research Engineer at [SC Solutions, Inc.](https://scsolutions.com/).

I earned my master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from [the University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) in 2023, under the guidance of [Prof. Xu Chen](https://faculty.washington.edu/chx/). During my master's studies, I worked on a system identification project that leverages irregular temporal feedback to identify dynamical systems beyond Nyquist frequency under a novel coprime collaborative sensing scheme.

Prior to that, I completed my bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from [the University of Arizona](https://www.arizona.edu/) in 2021, under the mentorship of [Prof. Qing Hao](https://ame.engineering.arizona.edu/faculty-staff/faculty/qing-hao). My undergraduate research centered on a boiling heat transfer project where we applied machine learning algorithms to uncover essential surface micro-structure descriptors crucial for predicting critical heat flux, contributing to the enhancement in high-power cooling technologies.
